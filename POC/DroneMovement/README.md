# MAVSDK & DroneKit POC

This script is a proof of concept to showcase movement commands for both MAVSDK and dronekit.


## Run Locally

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Information

In order to get the script to detect the drone you must adjust the ```DRONE_IP``` and ```PORT``` variables.
The ip variables will be different whether we are running the script on the PX4 or on our computers.
